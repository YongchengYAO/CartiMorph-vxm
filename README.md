# CartiMorph-vxm
A work based on [Voxelmorph](https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph) - an unsupervised learning model for image registration and template image construction



## Installation

```python
python -m pip install cartimorph_vxm==0.5
```

check the installation with

```python
python -c "import CartiMorph_vxm as vxm; print(vxm.__version__)"  
```

successful installation should return `0.5`



## Application:

CartiMorph-vxm is used in our research projects:

- [CartiMorph](https://github.com/YongchengYAO/CartiMorph):  a framework for automated knee articular cartilage morphometrics
- [CartiMorph Toolbox](https://github.com/YongchengYAO/CartiMorph-Toolbox): a platform for model training, model inference, transfer learning, and medical image computing
