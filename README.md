# CartiMorph-vxm
A work based on [Voxelmorph](https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph) - an unsupervised learning model for image registration and template image construction


CartiMorph-vxm is used in our research projects:
- [CartiMorph](https://github.com/YongchengYAO/CartiMorph):  a framework for automated knee articular cartilage morphometrics
- [CartiMorph Toolbox](https://github.com/YongchengYAO/CartiMorph-Toolbox): a platform for model training, model inference, transfer learning, and medical image computing
